        <p>The exterior experiments with a variety of approaches to concrete, including faceted, visually homogeneous modules and flat panels with exposed aggregate. Apertures either break the system with protruding bronze frames or hide behind modified, open-backed units. “While maintaining the overall opaque building volume, the objective of the façade was to still take advantage of the potential 
          for interactions with the environs, the seasonality, and various qualities of light,”

        <p>
        Hu says. “Viewed from a distance as a whole, the façade is read as a textural treatment, while closer encounters 
        from various angles reveal the faceting and play on light and shadow.”

        <h3>METAMORPHIC ARCHITECTURE</h3>
        <p>In September 2008 during the exhibition of Abitare il Tempo in Verona, Xaveer Claerhout and Barbara Van Biervliet introduced for the very first time the term : 'Metamorphic Architecture'. They also unveiled the ‘Kinetower’ and the first prototypes of metamorphic luminaires such as the ’New York lamp'. The ‘Kinetower’ is the visual 
          manifesto of their principle called ‘Metamorphism : towards a new kinetic architecture’.

        <h3>CREATING A METAMORPHIC REALITY</h3>
        <p>
          The groundbreaking works embodying the principles of metamorphic art, architecture and design have earned Metamorphic Art Studio a distinguished place in the permanent collection of the prestigious Centre Pompidou in Paris. Currently a portion of their metamorphic work 
          is on display in the fascinating exhibition 'un tiempo propio' at the Centre Pompidou of Malaga Spain still on view until October 15, 2023.

        <h3>The Clear Blue</h3>
        <p>
          At the heart of the fascination of Metamorphic Art Studio lies the creation of an innovative, state-of-the-art building that intertwines sustainability, metamorphosis and a reverence for the rich spatial traditions found in Roman and Palladian villas. Periscope architecture goes beyond mere reflection—it empowers to shift reality itself. By seamlessly merging metamorphic architecture with multifunctional mirrors that double 
          as screens, integrated as periscopes, the boundaries between virtual and physical realms dissolve harmoniously.
